GetFills
get
https://api.elections.kalshi.com/trade-api/v2/portfolio/fills
Endpoint for getting all fills for the member.

Query Params
ticker
string
Restricts the response to trades in a specific market.

order_id
uuid
Restricts the response to trades related to a specific order.

min_ts
int64
Restricts the response to trades after a timestamp.

max_ts
int64

limit
int32
1 to 1000
Parameter to specify the number of results per page. Defaults to 100.

cursor
string
The Cursor represents a pointer to the next page of records in the pagination.
So this optional parameter, when filled, should be filled with the cursor string returned in a previous request to this end-point.
Filling this would basically tell the api to get the next page containing the number of records passed on the limit parameter.
On the other side not filling it tells the api you want to get the first page for another query.
The cursor does not store any filters, so if any filter parameters like ticker, max_ts or min_ts were passed in the original query they must be passed again.

CancelOrder
delete

Endpoint for canceling orders.

The value for the orderId should match the id field of the order you want to decrease.
Commonly, DELETE-type endpoints return 204 status with no body content on success.
But we can't completely delete the order, as it may be partially filled already.
Instead, the DeleteOrder endpoint reduce the order completely,
essentially zeroing the remaining resting contracts on it.
The zeroed order is returned on the response payload as a form of validation for the client.
