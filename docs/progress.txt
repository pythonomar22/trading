# Statistical Arbitrage Project: Kalshi S&P 500 Range Contracts

## Project Components Todo List

### 1. Data Ingestion and Management
- [ ] Set up data pipeline for S&P 500 index (Daily OHLCV)
- [ ] Set up data pipeline for VIX index (Daily closing prices)
- [ ] Implement API integration with Kalshi for historical contract data
- [ ] Set up data pipeline for Kalshi S&P 500 range contracts
  - [ ] Range definitions
  - [ ] Bid/ask/last prices with timestamps
  - [ ] Settlement times and outcomes
- [ ] Design database schema for storing and accessing all data
- [ ] Implement data cleaning and preprocessing utilities
- [ ] Create timestamp alignment utilities for different data sources
- [ ] Implement missing value handling

### 2. Statistical Modeling
- [ ] Implement GARCH(1,1) model for volatility forecasting
- [ ] Implement distribution fitting (Normal, Student's t) for EOD price
- [ ] Develop rolling window training approach to avoid lookahead bias
- [ ] Create probability calculation module for S&P 500 EOD price ranges
- [ ] Implement model validation and performance metrics
- [ ] Design interface for model output to strategy module

### 3. Strategy Logic & Signal Generation
- [ ] Create module to calculate model probabilities (P_model)
- [ ] Implement logic to extract Kalshi market-implied probabilities (P_Kalshi)
- [ ] Develop comparison logic between P_model and P_Kalshi
- [ ] Implement trading signal generation with configurable thresholds
- [ ] Account for transaction costs in signal generation
- [ ] Design position sizing logic
- [ ] Implement portfolio approach for multiple ranges (optional)

### 4. Backtesting Engine
- [ ] Build event-driven or vectorized backtester
- [ ] Implement strict temporal logic to avoid lookahead bias
- [ ] Model Kalshi contract mechanics accurately
- [ ] Account for transaction fees and contract payouts
- [ ] Track portfolio value, profit/loss, and other performance metrics
- [ ] Implement risk management features
- [ ] Create trade logging functionality

### 5. Configuration & Utilities
- [ ] Set up YAML-based configuration system
- [ ] Create logging utilities
- [ ] Implement date manipulation utilities
- [ ] Develop common calculation helpers
- [ ] Set up environment and dependency management

### 6. Results Analysis & Reporting
- [ ] Create structured output format for backtest results
- [ ] Implement performance metrics calculations (Sharpe, max drawdown, etc.)
- [ ] Develop visualization tools for equity curves
- [ ] Build dashboards for strategy performance analysis
- [ ] Create export functionality for results

### 7. Project Management & Documentation
- [ ] Set up version control and repository structure
- [ ] Create documentation for code, models, and architecture
- [ ] Develop testing infrastructure for all modules
- [ ] Establish continuous integration pipeline (optional)
- [ ] Create user guides for running models and backtests
