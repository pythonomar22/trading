# Kalshi S&P 500 Statistical Arbitrage Project - TLDR

The project builds a trading system for Kalshi's S&P 500 price range contracts. We forecast S&P 500 EOD price distributions, compare our model's probabilities with Kalshi's market-implied probabilities, and trade when we identify significant differences.

## Quick Start
- To run data processing: `python src/data_processing.py`
- To fit GARCH model and forecast: `python src/train_and_forecast_example.py`
- To evaluate model performance: `python src/evaluate_volatility_model.py`

## Features
- Created detailed project plan and todo list
- Implemented data loading and preprocessing for S&P 500 and VIX
- Built GARCH volatility models with VIX integration
- Created distribution modeling for price probabilties
- Implemented thorough model evaluation framework
- Developed price range probability calculator

## Technical Components
1. Data Ingestion: S&P 500, VIX data processing pipeline
2. Statistical Modeling: GARCH for volatility, price distribution forecasting
3. Strategy Logic: Calculate model probabilities, pending Kalshi integration
4. Evaluation: Rolling window backtesting of volatility models
5. Analysis: Performance metrics and visualization tools

## How to Run
- Ensure Python 3.8+ with pandas, numpy, scipy, arch, sklearn, and matplotlib
- Place S&P 500 data at `data/snp500.csv` and VIX data at `data/vix.csv`
- Start with data processing script: `python src/data_processing.py`
- Run model training example: `python src/train_and_forecast_example.py`
